profilePic

When trying to create a pic for adding a profile picture to a web app, I found no options to copy and paste code for adding a profile photo. This made it a task that took too much time, so I thought why not make that solution. 

v0.0.0
This contains my working code for HTML/CSS/vanilla JS.
hoping to add multiple options such as React and jQuery etc. Contributions welcome, just submit a PR
